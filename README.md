## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify different **fabric defect types** in the textile industry. The goal is to help automate **defect detection** during fabric production using **deep learning** and **image analysis**. The model is trained on labeled fabric images representing multiple defect types and achieves strong classification accuracy.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of fabric images grouped into multiple defect categories such as:

| Label | Class Name |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Corrugation of Rails |
| 1 | Hogging of Rails |
| 2 | No Defects |
| 3 | Rail End Batter |
| 4 | Rail Wear |
| 5 | Scabbing of Rails |
| 6 | Shelling and Black Spots |
| 7 | Wheel Burns |

Each folder in the dataset contains training, validation, and testing images for each category.
